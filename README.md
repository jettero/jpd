# jpd

I wanted a little json search tool. I guess I'd also like an curses client (TUI)
some day â€¦ this is all pretty half assed, but it works the way I want.

If you wanna try it out, you'll need a `~/.jpd.yaml` config.

```
jpd:
  api_key: 'feeddeadbeeffeedbeef'
  email: 'paul@merb.net'
  user_id: ABCDEFG
  team_id: HIJKLMN
```
